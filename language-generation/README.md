# Language Generation (**Stable release**)

Language Generation (LG) allows developers to extract embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a LG runtime and file format. With LG, developers can create a more natural conversation experience by defining multiple variations on a phrase, executing simple expressions based on context, and referring to conversational memory.

This feature is no longer experimental. It is available in **Stable release**, starting botbuilder SDK version 4.9.0 and higher.
